The cryptocurrency market is receiving increasing attention, and the prediction of its prices is a vital financial and technological problem. Additionally, in recent years, there has been increasing interest in using sentiment information from social media to analyze and solve real-world problems. 
Twitter, as one of the most popular social media platforms, offers APIs for developers to grab real-time twitter data easily. In this project, we focus
on the possible relationship between Twitter sentiment and cryptocurrency. We build regression and time series models to predict bitcoin price. So far, we have done the steps of data collecting, data preprocessing, model construction and elementary result analysis. In the next 3 weeks, we will try to optimize the model and improve its performance.

Bitcoin is a type of digital money. Its currency is controlled by the 'consensus' or in other words, the will of its users. It contains a growing network 
of people who voluntarily agree to general protocol. Decentralized infrastructure is used to make transactions on a peer-to-peer basis. Its value is stored independently of any government, company, or financial institution. The value of Bitcoin has been touching new highs in the past few years, as many
favourable investors are betting big on the cryptocurrency to become a mainstream asset. Sentiment is an idea or feeling that someone expresses in words. With that in mind, sentiment analysis is the process of predicting/extracting these ideas or feelings. Based on twitter, one of the most popular social media, we can calculate sentiment values for the streaming data. 

We are interested in the trend of bitcoin price, as well as sentiment analysis using 
twitter streaming data. So we define the goal of the project as below.
